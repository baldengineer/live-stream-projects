## 52 VIC-20 TO-3 SMPS Replacement Regulator

The first revision of the Commodore VIC-20 used a linear regulator for its 5V rail. Being inside of the VIC-20, it generates a significant amount of heat.

This TO-3 board is a switching power supply. It runs significantly cooler with than the linear regulator and only generates a little more ripple voltage. 

It is designed to be a direct drop-in replacement for the LM323.

We put it together. It worked. Yay. The KiCad Design files can be found in the repo [Drop-In TO3 Switching Regulator](https://github.com/baldengineer/Drop-In-TO-3-Switching-Regulator). (What a terrible name!)
