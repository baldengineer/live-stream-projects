## 65 - Op-Amps without Op-Amps (but with an AVR128DB)
This stream is focused on measuring the performance of the op-amps. The actual code and project idea comes from David Johnson-Davies of Technoblogy.com.

1. [Pocket Op-Amp Lab](http://www.technoblogy.com/show?3CHT)
2. [DxCore](https://github.com/SpenceKonde/DxCore)
3. [Pocket Op-Amp Cookbook](http://www.technoblogy.com/show?3D9W)

In addition, the DxCore project adds AVR128DB support to the Arduino IDE and library. (There are other chips it includes as well.)
