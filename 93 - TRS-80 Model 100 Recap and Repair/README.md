## 2022-10-23 Stream Notes
* Schematic in KiCad: [https://github.com/hzeller/trs80-100-schematic](https://github.com/hzeller/trs80-100-schematic)

* M26 is drawn as a NAND gate, but a [TC40H002P](https://datasheetspdf.com/pdf/1258081/Toshiba/TC40H002P/1) is a NOR-gate
* M17 is drawn as an OR gate, but a [TC40H000P](https://datasheetspdf.com/pdf/553335/Toshiba/TC40H000P/1) is a NAND-gate.

The draws might be a boolean equiivlent? But I don't recognize the symbols
