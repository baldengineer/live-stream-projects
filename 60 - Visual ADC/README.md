## 60 - Visual ADC
Desinging a successive-approximation-registor analog-to-digital-converter. Otherwise known as a SAR ADC. 

My plan is to enter this project into an [element14 Community](https://element14.com/?ICID=baldengineer) contest. The [Project14 - Data Conversion](https://www.element14.com/community/community/project14/dataconversion?ICID=baldengineer) contest is all about, well, converting data.

Instead of a project involving data conversion, I wanted to build a discrete ADC. My pick is a "successive-approximation-registor" (SAR) ADC. Why? Because it needs a digital-to-analog converter to work! Also, because I think it would look really cool to have some LEDs and Relays when it runs.
