## 56 - 555 Timer Measurements

### Background
To test the voltage coefficient of a ceramic capacitor, I built a simple 555 timer circuit. The idea was to change VCC and see if the frequency changed with it. In that video (and that stream), I made a mistake. I assumed that the full VCC got applied to the timing capacitor. But that isn't the case. Now I want to see how a 555 really works.
