## 55 - Apple IIc Monitor Repair

### Background
I bought this Apple IIc computer and monitor off of eBay. The seller listed it as working. The computer took some physical damage. It needs a new Caps Lock key and a there is a dent in the case. Otherwise, it is functional (including the disk drive.)

The monitor does have a strange problem though. After it warms up AND the input signal is lost, the screen "skews" horizontally. The image is stable, so it is not a horizontal sync loss. If I let the monitor cool down for a few minutes, then it returns to normal.

There are two steps required to reproduce the problem:

1. Let the monitor warm up for at least 2 minutes.
2. Cycle the input signal. Either by power-cycling the monitor, unplugging/plugging in the composite cable, or power cycling the computer.

The monitor was tested with two different computers, the problem exists with both.
