## 68 - TOF VL53L0X Build 500
Testing a "time-of-flight" sensor from ST Microelectronics. You can use the VL53L0X as a proximity, distance, or gesture sensor. Current goal is to understand Arduino library support and get an idea of its indoor range.

## element14's Build Inside the Box Challenge
I am competing in [https://www.element14.com/community/docs/DOC-96361/l/build-inside-the-box-whats-in-the-box-member-challenge?ICID=baldengineer](Build Inside the Box Challenge). Two other of element14's Video Hosts are competing against me. We have to build a project using the the contents of this (not anymore) mystery box.

I am still deciding on what project to build.
