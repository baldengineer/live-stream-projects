## 71 - Build 500 Project

To celebrate element14 Presents' 500th build episode, they are challeging three of the video hosts to build a a project using 6 components.

I have to use all of these components, but can add others.

The project / build I am attemping is a Star Trek: The Next Generation style Tricorder.

## 2021-04-18 Stream Notes
Off stream, I got capacitive touch buttons to work. You can see them in this [Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CNtmSBfjlO5/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link).

Tried with four resistor values:
* 4.7K: stuck closer to open and wasn't very sensitive to light
* 220: barely worked, stayed open
* 60K: decent dynamic range, good sensitivity
* 100Kish: slightly better than 60K but had harder time going to open

 Bald Engineer's Livestream projects

Working repo for projects while I live stream. If the project evolves more, it will get moved to its own repo.

This repo is not intended to be a statement-of-record. Just a place to dump stuff while I work on it, so the best chat on the internet can help. :) Hi Chat!
