 Bald Engineer's Livestream projects

Working repo for projects while I live stream. If the project evolves more, it will get moved to its own repo.

This repo is not intended to be a statement-of-record. Just a place to dump stuff while I work on it, so the best chat on the internet can help. :) Hi Chat!
